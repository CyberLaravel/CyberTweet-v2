### **Laravel Policies**

-   Create a **policy** for each model that requires authorization.
-   Define **proper permissions** in the policy to control user access.
-   Register policies in `AuthServiceProvider` to ensure they are applied.
-   Use **gates** where necessary for fine-grained authorization.
-   Apply **policy methods** in controllers using `authorize()` or through routes.
-   Ensure policies align with **Spatie Laravel Permission v6** roles and permissions.
