### **Laravel Resources**

-   Use **Laravel API Resources** to format and transform data before returning responses.
-   Create a **dedicated resource class** for each model that requires structured output.
-   Utilize **resource collections** when handling multiple records.
-   Include **only necessary fields** to optimize performance and avoid exposing sensitive data.
-   Use **`toArray()`** method in resources to define the structure of transformed data.
-   Apply **conditional attributes** when necessary for flexibility.
