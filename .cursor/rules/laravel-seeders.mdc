### **Laravel Seeders**

-   **Use seeders to populate the database** with default or testing data (`database/seeders`).
-   **Call factories inside seeders** for bulk data creation (`User::factory()->count(50)->create()`).
-   **Define `run()` method properly** to execute seeding logic in each seeder file.
-   **Use `\DB::table('users')->insert([]);`** for inserting specific predefined records.
-   **Reference models directly** when necessary (`User::create([...])`).
-   **Use `call()` method inside `DatabaseSeeder`** to run multiple seeders sequentially.
-   **Always test seeding with `php artisan db:seed`** to verify correct data insertion.
-   **Use condition-based seeding** if you only want to seed missing data (`User::firstOrCreate([...])`).
