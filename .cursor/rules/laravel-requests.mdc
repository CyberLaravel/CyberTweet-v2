### **Laravel Requests (Form Requests)**

-   **Use Form Request classes** to handle validation, keeping controllers clean and focused on business logic.
-   **Define validation rules in the `rules()` method**, ensuring all input data is properly validated.
-   **Use the `authorize()` method** to restrict access when necessary, returning `true` for general access or implementing custom logic.
-   **Leverage custom validation messages** by defining them in the `messages()` method for better user feedback.
-   **Utilize `attributes()` method** to set custom attribute names, making error messages more readable.
-   **Apply dependency injection** within request classes to access authenticated users or other services.
-   **Validate complex data structures** using array validation, nested rules, and `Rule` classes when needed.
-   **Ensure consistency across requests**, creating separate Form Request classes for different actions (e.g., `StoreUserRequest`, `UpdateUserRequest`).
-   **Use `validated()` method** inside controllers to retrieve only the validated data, preventing mass assignment vulnerabilities.
-   **Extend the base Form Request class** when defining shared validation logic across multiple request classes.
