### **Laravel Controllers**

-   **Use Form Request classes** to handle validation, keeping controllers clean and focused on business logic.
-   **Never validate requests inside controllers**—all validation rules should be defined in dedicated request classes.
-   **Always return Inertia render pages**, not JSON responses, ensuring proper frontend handling via Inertia.js.
-   **Utilize Laravel API Resources** to transform and format data before sending it to the frontend.
-   **Apply the appropriate policy** to protect each controller, ensuring proper authorization based on roles and permissions.
-   **Follow RESTful principles** when designing controller methods to maintain consistency and readability.
-   **Keep controllers thin**—delegate complex business logic to services, repositories, or helper classes when necessary.
-   **Use route model binding** for cleaner and more efficient query resolution in controller methods.
-   **Ensure controllers interact efficiently with models**, utilizing eager loading to prevent N+1 query issues.
-   **Group related routes into controllers** and apply middleware where necessary to enhance security and maintainability.
