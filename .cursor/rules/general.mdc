    -   Provide only valid solutions that align with Laravel 11, Inertia.js, Vue.js 3, and Spatie Permission v6.
-   **Never remove old code that is responsible for other functionality**.
    
    -   When updating or refactoring, **preserve previous implementations** that are still in use.
    -   **Ensure existing functionality is not broken** when making modifications.
    
    -   Explain key logic, functions, and complex sections to improve readability and maintainability.
-   **Organize code following best practices for structure and readability**.
    
    -   Maintain proper indentation, naming conventions, and modular structure for better clarity.
-   **Use consistent formatting and adhere to coding standards**.
    
    -   Follow PSR-12 (PHP), ESLint (JavaScript), and Prettier (Vue) guidelines where applicable.
-   **Ensure modular and reusable code**.
    
    -   Break large functionalities into smaller, well-defined components, methods, or services.
-   **Keep controllers, models, and Vue components clean and structured**.
