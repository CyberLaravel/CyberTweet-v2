### **Laravel Models**

-   Define **all necessary relationships** in models to match the database schema.
-   Use **Eloquent accessors and mutators** to format and modify attributes when needed.
-   Implement **Eloquent scopes** for reusable query logic.
-   Ensure models **use the correct database table names and primary keys** when customizing defaults.
-   Use **casts** to automatically convert attribute types (e.g., JSON, dates, booleans).
-   Apply **Spatie Laravel Permission v6** where needed to handle roles and permissions.
-   Make sure each model includes **the appropriate relationships, fillable fields, and guarded attributes** for security.
